      body: `The **term structure** (or forward curve) shows the price of a commodity at different future delivery dates.\n\nTwo fundamental shapes:\n\n**Contango:** Future price > Spot price\n- "Normal" for storable commodities\n- Reflects cost of carry: storage + insurance + financing\n- Signals adequate nearby supply\n\n**Backwardation:** Future price < Spot price\n- Spot commands a premium\n- Signals tight nearby supply or strong immediate demand\n- Common during supply disruptions or harvest seasons`,

      title: 'Contango in Detail',
      body: `In contango, a nearby buyer can:\n1. Buy spot\n2. Store the commodity\n3. Sell forward at a higher price\n4. Earn the spread (minus costs)\n\nIf the forward premium exceeds cost of carry, this **cash-and-carry arbitrage** is profitable and traders exploit it until the premium collapses to fair value.\n\n**Cost of carry** = Storage cost + Insurance + Financing cost (interest)\n\nContango is why oil in tanks, grain in silos, and coffee in warehouses are all "financed" by the forward curve.`,

      id: 'backwardation',
      title: 'Backwardation in Detail',
      body: `In backwardation, spot prices are higher than forward prices.\n\nCauses:\n- Supply shortage: bad harvest, port strikes, logistics disruption\n- Seasonal demand peaks\n- Inventory drawdown (low warehouse stocks)\n\n**Squeeze risk:** An extreme form of backwardation where a dominant player controls nearby physical supply, forcing short hedgers to pay very high prices to close positions. The **Robusta coffee market** has seen recurring squeezes.`,

      title: 'Back, Middle & Front Office',
      body: `In a commodity trading house:\n\n**Front Office** — traders, originators, sales\n- Execute trades, manage positions, engage with counterparties\n- P&L responsible\n\n**Middle Office** — risk management, compliance\n- Monitor trader positions vs limits\n- Mark-to-market, exposure reporting\n\n**Back Office** — operations, settlements, accounting\n- Confirm trades, arrange logistics, process invoices\n- Coordinate shipping documents, warehouse receipts\n- Settle financial transactions\n\nAll three must communicate seamlessly — a breakdown between front and back is how operational losses happen.`,
